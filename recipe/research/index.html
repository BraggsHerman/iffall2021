                    <h1>Pan-Seared Salmon with Kale and Apple Salad</h1>

                    <p>The star of this dish is the kale salad. It's crunchy, tangy and sweet!</p>

                    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Four 5-ounce center-cut salmon fillets (about 1-inch thick) </li>
                            <li>3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice </li>
                            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil </li>
                            <li>Kosher salt </li>
                            <li>1 bunch kale, ribs removed, leaves very thinly sliced (about 6 cups)</li>
                            <li>1/4 cup dates</li>
                            <li>1 Honeycrisp apple</li>
                            <li>1/4 cup finely grated pecorino</li>
                            <li>3 tablespoons toasted slivered almonds</li>
                            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
                            <li>4 whole wheat dinner rolls</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h2>Directions</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Bring the salmon to room temperature 10 minutes before cooking.</li>
                        <li>Meanwhile, whisk together the lemon juice, 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Add the kale, toss to coat and let stand 10 minutes.</li>
                        <li>While the kale stands, cut the dates into thin slivers and the apple into matchsticks. Add the dates, apples, cheese and almonds to the kale. Season with pepper, toss well and set aside.</li>
                        <li>Sprinkle the salmon all over with 1/2 teaspoon salt and some pepper. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Raise the heat to medium-high. Place the salmon, skin-side up in the pan. Cook until golden brown on one side, about 4 minutes. Turn the fish over with a spatula, and cook until it feels firm to the touch, about 3 minutes more.</li>
                        <li>Divide the salmon, salad and rolls evenly among four plates.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>The <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/">Food Network</a> is very picture-heavy, which is think is great for a food focused website. That's what draws you in. The layout is clean and minimal, which makes it assessible and easy to navigate.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/">Taste of Home</a> almost feels like a peronal blog, which matches with their brand identity. I like the design decision to add a filter as the main interaction point, since it would allow me to pick what I want quite quickly.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipes/">Allrecipes</a> is almost like a combination of the others, with a sorting system at the top, and big images showing differnt food options, in a blog form. I think this works well to help pick foods if you're not sure on what you want to eat.</p>

                    <p> <a href="http://junlu.co/"> Jun Lu's portfolio</a> could be a very interesting place to start for a deconstructed look for a recipe site. Could think about tearing things down to the bare essentials.</p>
                    <p> <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/">Spotify</a> Could be a cool inspiration because there is a data focus, which could be interesting for finding the salient elements of recipes and showcasing them in that way.</p>
