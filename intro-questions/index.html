        <h1>Hey Everyone, I'm Herman!</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>I'm a Senior(yikes) Communication Design major.</li>
            <li>As a CommDes kid, this class is required, BUT I'm interested in interaction design so I lirobably would've taken it regardless.</li>
            <li>I've lilayed around a bit with HTML & CSS in my freetime, but I'm definitely looking to learn more in a structured way!</li>
            <li>I hope to learn more about the inner workings about how websites are built, both in form and in function.</li>
            <li>Screens are much more obviously mutable than paper. Differing sizes of screens and such will lead to layouts having to be more "liquid", allowing for multiple configurations.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple's</a> website showcases great design because I think that it feels accessible, straightforward, and visually appealing.
            from the navigation bar having the main products of interest easily laid out and with high contrast, to the large produt images filling the page with obvious clicking areas, it feels very clear as to the expected actions to take on the site.</li>
            <li><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo's</a> website effectively communicates its very straightforward purpose: to be a search engine for the internet. 
            The main point of interaction, the search bar, is front and center, with there being very simple and straightforward interactable elements. Even the mission statement is succinctly and clearly presented.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/play">Xbox's Game Streaming website</a> is an impressive showcase of modern streaming and internet technology. Basically, you can play any of the games in their catalouge over the cloud, a la Netflix.
            The process is super straightforward. Grab a controller, and just start up any game on the list, and it just loads in and works well, given you have stable internet.</li>
