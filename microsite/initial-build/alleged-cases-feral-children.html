                        The historian Herodotus wrote that Egyptian pharaoh Psammetichus I (Psamtik) sought to discover the origin of language, and prove Egypt was the oldest 
                        people on Earth by conducting an experiment with two children. Allegedly, he gave two newborn babies to a shepherd, with the instructions that no one 
                        should speak to them, but that the shepherd should feed and care for them while listening to determine their first words. The hypothesis was that the 
                        first word would be uttered in the root language of all people. When both of the children cried “becos” with outstretched arms, the shepherd concluded 
                        that the word was Phrygian because that was the sound of the Phrygian word for bread. Thus, they concluded that the Phrygians were an older people than 
                        the Egyptians.
