                    <h2>Hoaxes</h2>
                    <p>
                        Following the 2008 disclosure by Belgian newspaper Le Soir that the bestselling book Misha: A Mémoire of the Holocaust Years and movie Survivre 
                        avec les loups (“Surviving with Wolves”) was a media hoax, the French media debated the credulity with which numerous cases of feral children have 
                        been unquestioningly accepted. Although there are numerous books on these children, almost none of them have been based on archives; the authors instead 
                        have used dubious second- or third-hand printed information. According to the French surgeon Serge Aroles, who wrote a general study of feral children
                        based on archives (L'Enigme des Enfants-loups or The Enigma of Wolf-children, 2007), many alleged cases are totally fictitious stories:

                                The teenager of Kronstadt (1781) – According to the Hungarian document published by Serge Aroles, this case is a hoax: 
                                the boy, mentally handicapped, had a goitre and was exhibited for money.

                                Syrian Gazelle Boy (1946) – A boy aged around 10 was reported to have been found in the midst of a herd of gazelles in the Syrian desert in the 
                                1950s, and was only rescued with the help of an Iraqi army jeep, because he could run at speeds of up to 50 km/h (30 mph). However, it was 
                                supposedly a hoax, as are several other gazelle-boy cases.

                                Amala and Kamala – Claimed to have been found in 1920 by missionaries near Midnapore, Calcutta region, India, later proved to be a hoax to gain 
                                charity for Rev. Singh's orphanage. Scholars from Japan and France launched a new inquiry about Amala and Kamala, and validated the 
                                discoveries and conclusions done by Serge Aroles 20 years before: the story was a hoax.

                                Ramu, Lucknow, India, (1954) – A girl taken by a wolf as a baby, and raised in the jungle until the age of seven. Aroles made inquiries on the 
                                scene and classifies this as another hoax.
