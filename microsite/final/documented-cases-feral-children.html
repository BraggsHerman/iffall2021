                            <p>Marina Chapman claimed to have lived with weeper capuchin monkeys in the Colombian jungle from the age of five to about nine, 
                                following a botched kidnapping in about 1954. Unusual for feral children, she went on to marry, have children and live a 
                                largely normal life with no persisting problems.

                                Robert Mayanja (1982) lost his parents in the Ugandan Civil War at the age of three, when Milton Obote's soldiers raided their 
                                village, around 50 miles (80 km) from Kampala. Robert then survived in the wild, presumably with vervet monkeys, for three years 
                                until he was found by soldiers of National Resistance Army.

                                Saturday Mthiyane (or Mifune) (1987), a boy of around five, was found after spending about a year in the company of monkeys in 
                                KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. He was given the name Saturday after the day he was found, and Mthiyane was the name of the headmistress 
                                of the Special School which took him in. At the age of around 17, he could still not talk, and still walked and jumped like a monkey. 
                                He never ate cooked food and refused to share or play with other children. In 2005 he was killed in a fire.

                                he went to live with vervet monkeys. For two years he learned how to forage and travel. The monkeys protected him in the wild. When 
                                he was around seven years old, he was brought back to civilization. According to a local villager, the only forms of communication 
                                he was capable of were crying and demanding food, and he was a "wild boy" whom everyone feared.

                            <p>
                                Oxana Malaya was an eight-year-old Ukrainian girl who lived with Black Russian Terriers for six years. She was found in a kennel with dogs in 
                                1991. She was neglected by her parents, who were alcoholics. The three-year-old looking for comfort crawled into the farm and snuggled in with 
                                the dogs. Her behavior imitated dogs more than humans. She walked on all fours, bared her teeth, and barked. She was removed from her parents' 
                                custody by the social services. As she lacked human contact she did not know any words besides "yes" and "no". Upon adulthood, 
                                Oxana has been taught to subdue her dog-like behavior. She learned to speak fluently and intelligently and works at the farm milking cows, 
                                but remains somewhat intellectually impaired Years later, Oxana admitted on a Russian talk show that her story was slightly less dramatic; 
                                neglected by her parents, she sought out the company of the dogs and learned to imitate them as they were more responsive than her parents.

                                Ivan Mishukov, a six-year-old boy born in Reutov, Russia, was rescued by the police in 1998 from wild dogs, who he lived with for two years. 
                                He ran from his mother and her abusive alcoholic boyfriend at the age of four. He earned the dogs' trust by giving them food and in return 
                                the dogs protected him. The boy had risen to being "alpha male" of the pack. When the police found him, they set a trap for him and 
                                the dogs by leaving food in a restaurant kitchen. Because he had lived among the dogs for only two years, he relearned language fairly 
                                rapidly. He studied in military school and served in the Russian Army.

                                Traian Căldărar, Romania (found in 2002) also known as "the Romanian Dog Boy" or "Mowgli". From the ages of four to seven, Traian lived without 
                                his family. The boy was found at the age of seven and was described as a three-year-old due to undernutrition. His mother had left her home 
                                because of domestic violence, and Traian ran from home sometime after his mother left. He lived in the wild and took shelter in a cardboard 
                                box. He suffered from infected wounds, having poor circulation, and a children's disease caused by vitamin D deficiency. Traian was found by 
                                Manolescu Ioan, who had been walking across the country after his car broke down. In the surrounding area, a dog that had been eaten was also 
                                found. Many assume that the boy was eating the dog to stay alive. When Traian was being cared for, he would usually sleep under the bed and 
                                wanted to eat all the time. In 2007, Traian was being taken care of by his grandfather and was doing well in 3rd grade at school.

                                The "ostrich boy" – A boy named Hadara was lost by his parents in the Sahara desert at the age of two, and was adopted by ostriches. 
                                At the age of 12, he was rescued and taken back to society and his parents. He later married and had children. The story of Hadara 
                                is often told in west Sahara. In 2000, Hadara's son Ahmedu told his father's story to the Swedish author Monica Zak, who compiled it 
                                into a book.

                                Victor of Aveyron (1800) – Victor was a feral child in the forests of Aveyron for twelve years. The subject is treated with a certain amount 
                                of realism in François Truffaut’s 1970 film L’Enfant Sauvage (UK: The Wild Boy, US: The Wild Child), where a scientist's efforts in trying to 
                                rehabilitate a feral boy meet with great difficulty.
